** it to suit your needs.
**
** You can also *preload* libraries, so that a later 'require' can
** open the library, which is already linked to the application.
** For that, do the following code:
**
**  luaL_getsubtable(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, LUA_PRELOAD_TABLE);
**  lua_pushcfunction(L, luaopen_modname);
**  lua_setfield(L, -2, modname);
**  lua_pop(L, 1);  // remove PRELOAD table
