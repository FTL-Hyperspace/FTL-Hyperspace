### Downgrading on Humble

- Humble doesn't seem to offer an option for downloading older versions
- You might be able to request a copy of 1.6.9 from their support if you must use a humble copy
- Hopefully you're simply able to redeem your Steam key and follow the [steam instructions instead](/FTL-Hyperspace/install-guides/windows/steam-install)
