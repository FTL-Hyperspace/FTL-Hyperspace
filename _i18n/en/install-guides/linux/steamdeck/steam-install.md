**Uninstall any other FTL mods before proceeding!**

1. Launch FTL to make sure you're running the correct version
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/steamdeck_0.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/steamdeck_1.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/steamdeck_2.png' | relative_url }})
2. Ensure the version says `1.6.13` in the lower right, if it says 1.6.14 or somehow 1.6.9 you're accidentally running the Windows version under proton and need to turn off Steam play compatibility to run the native version.

# Multiverse Install
1. Download the "RAW Files" for Multiverse and not the installer
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv1.png' | relative_url }})
2. Open your downloads folder
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv2.png' | relative_url }})
3. Open slipstream's folder in a new window
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv3.png' | relative_url }})
4. Open slipstream's mods folder
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv4.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv5.png' | relative_url }})
5. Move over the two multiverse mod zips
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv6.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv7.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv8.png' | relative_url }})
6. Navigate back up to Slipstream's folder and right click `modman.command` and `Run in Konsole` to start Slipstream again
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv9.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv10.png' | relative_url }})
7. You should see something like this, with the Multiverse files missing, *don't panic* we need to tell slipstream to see zip files as mods
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv11.png' | relative_url }})
8. Go to slipstream's preferences
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv12.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv13.png' | relative_url }})
9. Check `allow_zip`
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv14.png' | relative_url }})
10. Apply
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv15.png' | relative_url }})
11. Now we need to tell slipstream to `Re-Scan mods/` under the file menu
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv16.png' | relative_url }})
12. Multiverse now shows up in the mods list
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv17.png' | relative_url }})
13. Check both multiverse files ***but do not select `Hyperspace`*** exactly as shown here
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv18.png' | relative_url }})
14. Hit `Patch`
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv19.png' | relative_url }})
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv20.png' | relative_url }})
15. If patching completed without error, you can launch the game here or from Steam (if you got an error in patching, download the zip files again you might have a corrupted download)
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv21.png' | relative_url }})
16. First the game loading should show up like this
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv22.png' | relative_url }})
17. After a short amount of time you should see `HS-x.x.x x64` in the upper right indicating the version of hyperspace that is loaded correctly
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv23.png' | relative_url }})
18. Enjoy the game
![image]({{ '/assets/img/install/steamdeck/steam/mv24.png' | relative_url }})
