# Installation

MacOS is currently not directly supported, however [Dino's Hyperspace Wrapper](https://github.com/The-Dumb-Dino/Dinos-Hyperspace-Wrapper-for-Mac) should allow you to run the Windows version of Hyperspace on Mac. Refer to the README on the GitHub page for the wrapper and the video guide for details. The guide covers installing vanilla Hyperspace and Multiverse.
