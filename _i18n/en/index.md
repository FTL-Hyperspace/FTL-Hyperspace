# FTL Hyperspace

A binary mod for the game FTL: Faster Than Light

## Overview

FTL: Hyperspace is a hard-coded mod (or "exe mod") which aims to extend the modding capabilities of FTL.
It provides a backend to more complex mods which were never possible before, adding features such as the ability to add completely new races with their own stats, a ship selector with infinite pages, and combining augments to create completely new ones.

Seeded runs are now a feature of Hyperspace, too! You can input a seed before starting a run which will disable unlocks and generate the map based on the seed, allowing you to redo a run or play the same run as someone else (to race them, for example!).

Currently, the biggest mod which utilizes Hyperspace is [FTL: Multiverse](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35332). Go check them out!

The mod also contains some Quality of Life changes to FTL, such as a numerical hull indicator for the player and enemy.

## Installation

Please see the respective install guide for:
- [Windows](install-guides/windows/index.html)
- [Linux & Steam Deck](install-guides/linux/)
- [MacOS](install-guides/mac/)

## Mod Makers

Most of the features that you can use from Hyperspace are documented in data/hyperspace.xml in Hyperspace.ftl.
Use a hyperspace.xml.append and add the xml tags you need for your mod.
Ideally, the user would download Hyperspace as well as your mod, and install Hyperspace.ftl first then your mod.
For maximum compatibility with other mods, don't redistribute the Hyperspace resource files or binaries and instead just direct the user to download Hyperspace in your forum post.

The Lua API for 1.2.0 and above is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace/wiki)

Additional documentation is/will be available in the [wiki](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace/wiki).
If you would like to suggest improvements to the wiki it is welcomed by creating an issue on github & linking to a clone of the wiki repository or providing a snippet in markdown to add/modify.
