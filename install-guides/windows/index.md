## Updating

Simply replace `Hyperspace.dll` (and any other DLLs included in the hyperspace ZIP) with the new one in your FTL installation directory.
Updating the `Hyperspace.dll` is **crucial** for Multiverse updates as they always build for the latest hyperspace.

Patch the new `Hyperspace.ftl` with slipstream if you are using a mod that requires it (*do not patch `Hyperspace.ftl` for Multiverse*)

## First time Installs

### What FTL installation do you have?

- [Steam](./steam-install)
- GoG
- Humble Bundle
- Epic Games
- Origin
- Microsoft Store/Xbox Game Pass
