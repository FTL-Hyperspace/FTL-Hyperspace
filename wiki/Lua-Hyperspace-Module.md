## ShipManager

**Extends [ShipObject](#Shipobject)**

As ShipManager extends ShipObject, the methods of ShipObject can be called from ShipManager.

### Methods
- `Pointf :GetRandomRoomCenter()`
   - Chooses a random room on the ship and returns the center point of that room
- `Pointf :GetRoomCenter(int roomId)`
   - Gets the room center point of a specific room id.
- `std::pair<int, int> :GetAvailablePower()`
   - First element of the pair is the maximum reactor power, the second element is the available reactor power.
- `CrewMember* :AddCrewMemberFromBlueprint(CrewBlueprint *bp, int slot, bool init, int roomId, bool intruder)`
- `CrewMember* :AddCrewMemberFromString(std::string name, std::string race, bool intruder, int roomId, bool init, bool male)`
- ~~`:AddDrone`~~
- ~~`:AddEquipmentFromList`~~
- ~~`:AddInitialCrew`~~
- `int :AddSystem(int systemId)`
- ~~`int :AddWeapon(WeaponBlueprint weapon, int slot)`~~
- `bool :CanFitSubsystem(int systemId)`
- `bool :CanFitSystem(int systemId)`
- `int :CanUpgrade(int systemId, int amount)`
- `void :ClearStatusAll()`
- `void :ClearStatusSystem(int system)`
- ~~`CollisionResponse :CollisionMoving(Pointf start, Pointf finish, DamageParameter damage, bool raytrace)`~~ (Not yet available, CollisionResponse is not exposed yet)
- ~~`bool :CommandCrewMoveRoom(CrewMember *crew, int roomId)`~~
- `int :CountCrew(bool boarders)`
   - return count of crew on this ship, true for boarders false for regular crewmembers.
- `int :CountCrewShipId(int roomId, int shipId)`
   - Counts crew in a room. shipId corresponds to which ship owns the crewmembers, 0 being the player and 1 being the enemy.
- ~~`CrewDrone* :CreateCrewDrone(DroneBlueprint *bp)`~~ Use Events
- ~~`SpaceDrone* :CreateSpaceDrone(DroneBlueprint *bp)`~~ Use Events
- `bool :DamageArea(Pointf location, DamageParameter dmg, bool force)`
   - I think this causes damage to a area like when a projectile hits but it's not tested yet, could possibly be used for bursts?
   - `force` ignores room resistances.
- `bool :DamageBeam(Pointf location1, Pointf location2, DamageParameter dmg)`
   - I think this cuts a beam across the ship but not sure if it renders a beam or not, could possibly be used for bursts?
###### Example
```lua
local damage = Hyperspace.Damage()
damage.iDamage = 1
Hyperspace.ships.player:DamageBeam(Hyperspace.ships.player:GetRandomRoomCenter(), Hyperspace.ships.player:GetRandomRoomCenter(), damage)
```
- ~~`bool :DamageCrew(CrewMember *crew, DamageParameter dmg)`~~
- `int :DamageHull(int amount, bool force)`
   - It directly damages the hull? What's more to say, I think negative numbers heal the hull. Could be cool for some random lifesaving or lifetaking mechanics that run mid-battle instead of during an event. Imagine if you could dump all power into hull integrity or something and lose 10% power for the rest of the fight but gain 10% hull, could be fun!
   - `force` ignores whether or not the ship is jumping. If it is false and the ship is jumping, the damage will not be applied.
- `void :DamageSystem(int systemId, DamageParameter damage)`
- `bool :DoSensorsProvide(int vision)`
   - `vision` is the sensor level.
- `bool :DoorsFunction()`
   - Do the doors work or not
- ~~`CrewMember* :FindCrew(CrewBlueprint *bp)`~~ Not currently available, might choose never to make available because it might be better to lookup crew by name or something rather than their full CrewBlueprint
- `bool :ForceDecreaseSystemPower(int systemId)`
- `CrewMember* :GetCrewmember(int slot, bool present)`
- `int :GetDodgeFactor()`
- `bool :GetDodged()`
   - Calculates whether a projectile should be dodged or not.
   - Note: 5 calls of this method that return false while the player has fully upgraded, fully powered engines will unlock the achievement 'Astronomically Low Odds'.
- `int :GetDroneCount()`
   - Returns the number of drone parts the ship has.
- [`Drone*[]`](#drone) `:GetDroneList()`
   - Returns the list of Drones for this ship, the `std::vector` it returns can be accessed like an array in Lua
- `int :GetFireCount(int roomId)` Get number of fires in a room, could be quite useful for computing damage of multiple fires
- ~~`std::vector<CrewMember*> :GetLeavingCrew(bool intruders)`~~
- `int :GetOxygenPercentage()` Ship's overall oxygen percentage (not per-room)
- `CrewMember* :GetSelectedCrewPoint(int x, int y, bool intruder)`
- `ShieldPower :GetShieldPower()`
- [`ShipSystem*`](#shipsystem) `:GetSystem(int systemId)`
   - You can also just access the system directly with fields below if it's one of the vanilla systems like `oxygenSystem` `medbaySystem` etc... but custom systems like Temporal currently need to be accessed by id.
- [`ShipSystem*`](#shipsystem) `:GetSystemInRoom(int roomId)`
   - Returns the system in a specific room id. If there is no system in the room, returns 0.
- `int :GetSystemPower(int systemId)`
   - How much power is assigned to this system
- `int :GetSystemPowerMax(int systemId)`
   - What is the max power level of this system, functionally this is the same as the system's "level"
- `int :GetSystemRoom(int systemId)`
   - Find what roomId a system is in, could be useful for AI targeting mechanics or some cheesy player weapon that can only attack one system or something.
- `string :GetTooltip(int x, int y)`
- `ProjectileFactory*[] :GetWeaponList()`
   - Return a vector of weapons on this ship, can be treated like an array in Lua.
- `bool :HasSystem(int systemId)`
   - Does the ship have a specific system, true/false
- `void :InstantPowerShields()`
- `bool :IsCrewFull()`
- `bool :IsCrewOverFull()`
- `int :IsSystemHacked(int systemId)`
   - Returns the "hacking level" of the system. 0 means there is no hacking drone on the system, 1 means there is a hacking drone attached but is not currently being hacked, 2 means there is a hacking drone and the system is being hacked.
- `void :ModifyDroneCount(int drones)`
- `void :ModifyMissileCount(int missiles)`
- `void :ModifyScrapCount(int scrap, bool income)`
   - `income` determines whether or not augments should be activated (e.g. Scrap Recovery Arm and Repair Arm).
- `void :PrepareSuperBarrage()`
   - I do not know if this is safe to call
- `void :PrepareSuperDrones()`
   - I do not know if this is safe to call
- `void :RemoveItem(string name)`
   - Remove an item by name (equivalent to removing via an event).
- `void :ResetScrapLevel()`
- `bool :RestoreCrewPositions()`
   - Same as hitting the button to return crew to their original positions.
- `CrewBlueprint :SelectRandomCrew(int seed, string racePreference)`
   - Select random crew from the ship *for ~~execution~~ selection of your diabolical plans*.
   - Not sure why there is a seed option, not sure if you should give it a fixed number or call `Hyperspace.random32()` for a nice random number.
- `void :SetDestroyed()`
   - *Blow up the damn ship Jean-Luc!*
- `void :SetSystemPowerLoss(int systemId, int powerLoss)`
   - Sets a power loss level, like from an event except can be done at any time regardless of an event.
- `void :StartFire(int roomId)`
   - Yeah, it does *exactly what you think it does* [you monster](https://gfycat.com/complexcarefulant).
- `bool :SystemFunctions(int systemId)`
   - Returns whether the system has any power assigned to it.
- `CrewMember*[] :TeleportCrew(int roomId, bool intruders)`
   - Teleport crew & get back the list of CrewMembers.
   - I think there might be something more you need to do to give them a destination so they don't simply get teleport-ed to space, *unless you know... that was the intention*.

-  `bool :FullRoom(int roomId, bool intruder)`
   -  Returns true if the room cannot fit any more crew of the allegiance specifies by the `intruder` arg. If `intruder` is false, counts player crew when on the player ship, and enemy crew when on the enemy ship.

-  `void LockdownRoom(int roomId, Pointf pos)` 
   -  Locks down the room, and spawns the crystal animation at `pos`. Does not play the lockdown sound. Note: For a "normal" animation, `pos` can be set to the room's center, but it can be set outside of the room as well.
-  `bool RoomLocked(int roomId)`
   -  Returns true if the room is locked down.
-  `void SetRoomBlackout(int roomId, bool blackout)`
   -  When `blackout` is true, hide the room's interior (As if sensors were disabled). When it is false, show the room's interior. Note: This must be done every tick to have an effect.
-  `void SetSelectedRoom(int roomId)`
   -  Sets the room to be selected (Yellow outline). Note: Must be done every tick to have an effect.

### Hyperspace Fields
-  `std::vector<std::pair<Animation, int8_t>>` 
`extraEngineAnim`
   -  Engine animations defined in Hyperspace for the ship. The first member of the pair is the animation. The second member of the pair is an integer indicating rotation of the animation. 
   
   |Value | Rotation                     |
   | ---: | :--------------------------- |
   | -1   | 90 Degrees Clockwise         |
   |  0   | No Rotation                  |
   |  1   | 90 Degrees Counterclockwise  |

   Note: Pairs are returned by value, and not by reference.
## ShipSystem

### Static methods
These are called either under `Hyperspace.ShipSystem` or an existing object (for example you could call `Hyperspace.ShipSystem.GetLevelDescription()` or `Hyperspace.ships.player.oxygenSystem.GetLevelDescription()`) with the same effect (although constructors probably don't make any sense to call in the second manner)
- `Hyperspace.ShipSystem.ShipSystem()` Default Constructor
- ~~`Hyperspace.ShipSystem.ShipSystem(int systemId, int roomId, int shipId, int startingPower)` Constructor~~
- `string .GetLevelDescription(int systemId, int level, bool tooltip)`
- `bool .IsSubsystem(int systemType)`
- `int .NameToSystemId(string name)`
- `string .SystemIdToName(int systemId)`

### Methods
- `void :SetSelected(int selectedState)`
- `int :GetSelected()`
- `bool :CompletelyDestroyed()`
- `string* :GetName()`
- `void :SetName(string name)`
- `void :Repair()`
   - Not sure if this is a function called every tick to cause repairs or what, probably not useful to lua
- `bool :PartialRepair(float speed, bool autoRepair)`
   - Cause a partial repair of a system (opposite of partialDamage) must be called every tick or else you will not see any change
- `bool :PartialDamage(float amount)`
   - Must be called every tick or else you will not see any change
- `bool :NeedsRepairing()`

- `int :IsMannedBoost()`
- `void :LockSystem(int lock)`
- `void SetPowerCap(int cap)`
- `int SetPowerLoss(int power)`
- `bool UpgradeSystem(int amount)`
   - Upgrading a system is basically the same as changing the max power of a system although I think max power might reset after a jump? Not sure haven't tested.
   - I think negative upgrades (downgrades) are allowed, please report if they are not.

## StatBoostManager

### Methods
- `StatBoostManager .GetInstance()`
    - Returns the main instance of `StatBoostManager`. Always use this to access any members and methods belonging to this class.

-- Function to apply a 10 second health boost to every crew member on a ship
local def = Hyperspace.StatBoostDefinition()
def.stat = Hyperspace.CrewStat.MAX_HEALTH
def.amount = 100
def.boostType = Hyperspace.StatBoostDefinition.BoostType.FLAT
def.boostSource = Hyperspace.StatBoostDefinition.BoostSource.AUGMENT
def.shipTarget = Hyperspace.StatBoostDefinition.ShipTarget.ALL
def.crewTarget = Hyperspace.StatBoostDefinition.CrewTarget.ALL
def.duration = 10
def.realBoostId = Hyperspace.StatBoostDefinition.statBoostDefs:size()
Hyperspace.StatBoostDefinition.statBoostDefs:push_back(def)
function player_crew_health_boost()
	local crewList = Hyperspace.ships.player.vCrewList
	for i = 0, crewList:size() - 1 do
		local crew = crewList[i]
		Hyperspace.StatBoostManager.GetInstance():CreateTimedAugmentBoost(Hyperspace.StatBoost(def), crew)
