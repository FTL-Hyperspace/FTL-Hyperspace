<!--
    Old version check is just a number and must match exactly.
    <version>92</version>
    The old version check will be removed at some point in the future.

    New version check is based on a Major.Minor.Patch version number
    Major versions are for (ideally) backwards incompatible changes
    Minor versions are for new features
    Patch versions are for bugfixes/patches/etc...
    There are 3 ways of matching a Hyperspace version for a mod now
    <version>=0.9.2</version> An exact match, only accept this EXACT version of hyperspace
    <version>~0.9.2</version> A feature match, only accept higher patch versions in this case versions 0.9.2 thru 0.9.255 would be allowed but not 0.9.1 or 0.9.0
    <version>^0.9.2</version> A major match, allows minor & patch to be changed (upwards) but not major, in this case 0.10.0 would match as would 0.9.5 but not 1.0.0.
    If you fail to specify a match character and just do <version>0.9.2</version> this will be considered the same as `^` above but will also generate a warning message in FTL_HS.log.
-->
<version>^1.20.0</version>

<!-- Languages

Adds new languages onto the game's localization system. Each language needs its own localization files to properly work.
See data/names.xml and data/text-<langcode>.xml files in the vanilla data for reference.

@langcode:      (required) The handle of the language. You may name it whatever you'd like as long as it matches
                @language attribute for localized strings, but for consistency with the vanilla game we'd recommend
                using a variant of ICU locale ID (See https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/locale/#examples)
                that replaces underscores to dash (e.g., `zh_Hans` becomes `zh-Hans`).
@fontOverride:  (optional) Specify a custom font (ttf) to be used for this language. If specified, this font has
                precedence over ALL the other fonts, effectively replacing the entire font for that language.
                This behavior resembles how Simplified Chinese works in the vanilla.

These achievements will be displayed for custom ships (where the ship achievements would normally be).
On the ship select screen, a new filter window will be created for the player to select up to three different victory achievements to display while browsing ships.

If this feature is used, a "flagship" victory type will automatically be created unless noFlagship="true". The default definition can be overwritten with your own.
Other victory types are granted using the "ach" attribute on a <win> or <finalBoss> tag.

For each victory achievement, you can give a name and description (\1 = ship class name, e.g. "Kestrel Cruiser").
Icon is the 32x32 icon to use, switching between achievements/icon_on.png and achievements/icon_off.png depending on if the achievement is unlocked.
Color is the RGB color to use for the layout pips on the achievement.
If <quiet/> is included, no achievement popup will appear when the victory achievement is unlocked.
If <secret/> is included, the achievement will not show up in the hangar unless you have completed it with at least one ship.
If <filter/> is included, the achievement will be enabled by default in the filters for showing ship victory achievements on the ship select screen.

<!-- Custom Achievements

General achievements that can be awarded that aren't tied to victories/ship victories.
The "page" tag can be used to populate the stats screen.
Each page may have one or more sections; if they don't fit you will get automatic page breaks.

You need the following assets:
scoreUI/score_main_right_2a.png - version of scoreUI/score_main_right_2.png but without the rectangles inside the window
scoreUI/score_main_right_2b.png - version of scoreUI/score_main_right_2a.png but the inside of the window should be the background you want inside the rectangles (optional)
scoreUI/score_main_right_border.png - standalone version of the rectangle border. Can be filled in or transparent. Optional; default is to draw a 4px border using statsBorderColor.

Use score_main_right_2b when you want a fixed window pattern that renders with two different tints depending on whether it's inside an achievement section box or not.
Omit score_main_right_2b when you don't care about matching a pattern outside and inside the boxes, or if you plan to use a solid color (opaque or translucent) for the section boxes for contrast.

<!-- Infinite Ships

You can make a customShip with no name (or name "default") to set default values for all ships
Make sure this is above every <ship> and <customShip> tag, though

<roomAnim> lets you choose animations for rooms (from animations.xml)
roomAnim render layers:
0 - draws below everything except floor, including no O2 stripes - can't see when room has no vision
1 - draws below everything but above O2 stripes - can't see when room has no vision
2 - draws below crew - can see when room has no vision
3 - draws above crew - can see when room has no vision, but not when you can't actually see the room outline
4 - draws above everything

<partition> lets you define backup rooms for ships where crew might not always be able to reach their saved stations
use <rooms> to define the rooms inside the partition, use <backups> to define rooms for saved stations
you can use <slot> to define specific slots for backup rooms inside <backups>
define as many partitions as needed

<customReactor> goes inside <customShip>, contains the tags that let you set the prices for upgrading the reactor
maxLevel attribute sets the maximum level you can upgrade to
<baseCost> defines the cost of the first 5 levels
<increment> sets how much more expensive each coloumn gets
<overrideCost> sets the price of an individual coloumn specified in the attribute, every other coloumn will follow default scaling
<artilleryGibMountFix> applies the fix to this ship if not already enabled globally
<hideHullDuringExplosion> hides the hull of this ship if not already enabled globally
<augSlots> sets the number of augment slots for custom ship
<cargoSlots> sets the number of cargo slots for custom ship
<exclusivityOverride> defines groups of mutually exclusive systems for the ship. If present, ignores all global <exclusivityGroup> tags and <dualMedical>.


<empty> in shipOrder means that the slot that the ship would take up is empty instead

Unlocks:
variant attribute is what variant you want the unlock method for (a, b or c)

type is the unlock method (0 is beat flagship, 1 is reach sector, 2 is any victory, 3 is other ship unlocks, 4 is for event unlocks, 5 is for other ship victories)
shipReq is the ship that you have to do it with to unlock it
value is only used for reach sector currently which defines which sector the player has to reach
silent tag defines whether or not it will show up in the top right and plays the sound

for the achievement icon that appears on the top right when you unlock the ship, you will need to add an icon in img/achievements
it will use whatever the layoutFile is with "_1" put on the end
so for the engi ship, the layoutFile is mup_engi_b, so the icon would be img/achievements/mup_engi_b_1.png

you can also put multiple unlock methods which will let the player do ANY of them to unlock the ship
putting the secret attribute on the ship tag will make the ship show up as "Unidentified Cruiser" when hovering over it in the ship selection screen

If noAppend is true, the ship won't be automatically appended to the back of the ship pages; it will only appear if explicitly added using the <shipOrder>

Unlock arrows:

Adds an arrow to the page to show which ship this ship unlocks. Put the ID of the target ship WITH the variant suffix.
 variant - The variant to associate the arrow with. Source and target ship must be the same variant. If "all" or omitted then the arrow appears on every page (but the target ship is always the specific variant).
 tooltip - Text ID to use for hover tooltip.
 tooltipText - Literal text to use for hover tooltip.
 image - full image name of arrow asset. Uses default victory arrow asset in corresponding direction if omitted.
 lockedImage - full image name of arrow asset when source ship is locked. Uses default locked arrow asset in corresponding direction if omitted.
 unlockedImage - full image name of arrow asset when target ship is unlocked. NO default; if unspecified then no arrow is rendered when the target ship is unlocked.
 direction - direction which the arrow points, used to place the image relative to the button. Omit for default 0,0 offset.
 x and y - offset coordinates for arrow after applying the automatic offset from the direction attribute.
 mirrorX and mirrorY - mirrors the arrow asset over the X and Y axes respectively.

Victory/Quest achievements:

A victory achievement will automatically be generated for all non-vanilla ships. A quest achievement will also be generated if the ship has unlock method 4.
Victory achievements will be granted upon any victory with the ship.
Quest achievements will be granted upon unlocking the ship via event (or if the ship would have been unlocked had it not already been unlocked).

By default, all layouts of a given ship are treated as the same ship and share achievements, with completion recorded per-layout, like for vanilla victory achievements.
splitUnlockQuestAchievement and splitVictoryAchievement will cause the quest and victory achievements respectively to be split so that each layout is treated as a distinct ship.

If showShipAchievements is set to false, ship achievements will never be visible when that ship is selected (true by default).

<!-- Custom Thruster Animations

You can define thruster animations in the XML of individual ships (kestral.xml for example). The animation must be defined in animations.xml.

Syntax ->

<thrusters sync="true">                                              If sync = true, all thruster animations will start on their first frame rather than on a random frame.
    <thruster x="25" y="90" mirror="true">thrusters_on</thruster>    If mirror = true, the animation will be flipped along the y axis.
    <thruster x="87" y="90">thrusters_on</thruster>
</thrusters>

-->



<!-- Custom Races

For buttonText and tooltip you can either use "id" or use the value of buttonText - "id" pulls it from text_misc.xml.

jumpCooldown can either be "continue", "reset", or "full", and it is "full" by default (for crystals).

animSheet pulls from img/people/<animSheet>.png and acts as a layer on top of the crew

healSpeed determines how fast crew heal in the medbay/from non-true healing sources and how fast drones heal in the drone control room.

When animFrame is set for <powerEffect> and <temporaryPowerEffect> it makes it so that the effect only happens on that frame of the effect animation.

When animSoundFrame is set for <repairSounds> AND <animBase> is rock, instead of having a looping repair sound it will instead play a single sound at that frame of the animation.
Support was recently added for non-rock <animBase>, but is untested.

<transformRace> in <powerEffect> allows the crewmember to transform into another race while keeping their name and skills

<nameRace> allows the crewmember to change into a different race if they are given a certain name (indicated by the transformName attribute), and the changeIfSame attribute (default to true) specifies whether they change when they *are* named that, or *aren't* named that

<animBase> can be either mantis or rock

Syntax ->

<crew>
	(default human values except where they're obviously not)
	<race name="newRace">
		<nameRace transformName="Admiral Billy" changeIfSame="true">newRace2</nameRace>  Transforms the crew's race to newRace2 if they're given the transformName (or if changeIfSame is false, if they are given a different name).
		<noSlot>false</noSlot>                                                           If true, this crewmember does not count as an actual crewmember in the crew manifest.
		<crewSlots>1.0</crewSlots>                                                       Can set crewmembers to use one slot, multiple slots, fractional slots, or even no slots (this differs from noSlot in that your crew will still fully count as a crewmember, appear on the manifest, etc., just that they won't count towards your limit).
		<noClone>false</noClone>                                                         If true, this crewmember cannot be cloned.
		<essential>0</essential>                                                         Higher value is less likely to be picked in crew events (for crew loss, etc.).

		<controllable>true</controllable>                                                If true, the player can control this crewmember. Otherwise it acts like an AI crewmember.
		<noAI>false</noAI>                                                               If true, the AI cannot control this crewmember.
		<selectable>false</selectable>                                                   If true, the player can select this crewmember if it belongs to them, even if they are not controllable. No effect when controllable.
		<canRepair>true</canRepair>                                                      If true, this crewmember can repair systems and breaches and put out fires.
		<canSabotage>true</canSabotage>                                                  If true, this crewmember can sabotage enemy systems.

		<canTeleport>true</canTeleport>                                                  If true, this crewmember can be teleported by the crew teleporter.
		<canSuffocate>true</canSuffocate>                                                If true, this crewmember will take damage in rooms with low oxygen.
		<canBurn>true</canBurn>                                                          If true, this crewmember will take damage in rooms with fires.
		<validTarget>true</validTarget>                                                  If false, this crewmember cannot be targeted by enemy crew.

		<snapToSlot>false</snapToSlot>                                                   If true, then when canMove is false the crewmember will be instantly moved to the centre of their slot.
		<teleportMove>false</teleportMove>                                               Crew can move within the ship by teleporting.
		<teleportMoveOtherShip>false</teleportMoveOtherShip>                             Crew can teleport to the other ship on their own (without the system). Right click with selected crew to teleport.

<!-- Custom drones

crewBlueprint needs to be defined as a crewBlueprint in blueprints.xml and a custom race in the <crew> tag in hyperspace.xml
tooltipName is the name that shows up when you hover over the drone
A flying boarding drone uses a _fly animation (e.g. newDrone_fly) for its texture
The animations for drones will use the <crewBlueprint> tag for a prefix. Look at "boarder_" animations in vanilla as an example.

Syntax ->

<drones>
	<drone name="BATTLE_CUSTOM">
		<crewBlueprint>newDrone</crewBlueprint>
		<tooltipName>Anti-Personnel Drone II</tooltipName>
	</drone>
</drones>

-->

<drones>

</drones>

<!-- Custom Augments

<locked> means you cannot remove it (sell or replace with another augment) once it's equipped.
useForReqs is for whether you want the augment to work for blue options or not. True by default.
warning attribute being false removes red warning text
sys attribute means that a functional system is required for the augment to be effective.
modifyChoiceTextScrap is only used for SCRAP_COLLECTOR; it causes the scrap amounts shown in event dialogues to account for the augment. It does not affect the "scrap collected" in the stats or the player's score.

<crystalShard> emulates crystal vengeance but allows you to set your own blueprint. stackable can either be "false", "true", or "independent".
Independent means to roll for a proc independently for each stack of the augment. Otherwise the chance of a proc is accumulated for each unique weapon blueprint.
You can use a blueprint list as well to roll a random weapon effect.
Number of projectiles per proc is based on the shot count of the weapon blueprint (doesn't work for beams).

<superShield> lets you specify a custom super shield value instead of the default 5. Generally should be used along with <function name="ENERGY_SHIELD"/> so it still counts for blue options, etc.
You can also specify a custom shield image and tint. Custom images are useful for colors that don't work well on the standard blue shield, such as yellow, red, pink, and white.
Using <shieldImage> is equivalent to using both <playerImage> and <enemyImage>.
The vanilla energy shield (augment with ENERGY_SHIELD function but no custom <superShield>) is treated equivalently to a <superShield> with 5 points and no custom rendering.

Syntax ->
<augments>
    <aug name="CUSTOM_AUG">
    	<function name="ADV_SCANNERS"/>

		<function name="DEFENSE_SCRAMBLER" sys="hacking"/>

		<crystalShard weapon="CRYSTAL_1" value="0.1" stackable="false"/> (can be repeated for multiple crystalShard functions on the same augment)

		<superShield>
			<value>5</value> (gives custom supershield value; when multiple augments are present the highest value is used)
			<add>0</add> (gives custom supershield value that is added to existing custom supershields to allow stacking)
			<color r="100.0" g="255.0" b="100.0" a="1.0"/> (changes the super shield tint)
			<shieldImage>ship/shield_image.png</shieldImage> (use a different shield image for player and enemy)

<!-- Stat boosts

NOTE:
TO USE STAT BOOSTS, THE RACE MUST BE LAID OUT AS A CUSTOM CREW IN THE <crew> TAG

Stat boosts can be added in one of two ways: through crew, and through augments.
For augments and crew active abilities, statboosts should be placed in a <statBoosts> tag (as many as you want, the <statBoosts> tag should contain all of them)
For passive crew boosts, they should be placed in a <passiveStatBoosts> tag, but otherwise the code is the same
As the name implies, stat boosts can be used to boost (or just generally modify) a given stat, but also you can use stat boosts to apply other stat boosts to crew (therefore buffing everyone except the recipient) by using "statBoost" for the statBoost name

The "load" and "save" attributes can be used to copy stat boosts. Note that the stat boost definition that is saved must come before any stat boosts that load it.
You can also define tags with a loaded stat boost and it will make a copy and set the additional attributes.
If the stat boost source (CREW or AUGMENT) does not match the saved stat boost, then the definition is copied. Stat boosts inside other stat boosts are CREW source.
If you load a saved stat boost without additional tags, the definition will be loaded by reference (not copied).

boostType: what the boost does to the stat; for numerical amounts, it can be FLAT, MULT, SET, MIN or MAX, and for true/false values it can be SET or FLIP
  The MIN and MAX types will apply the min() and max() operators. min() selects the lower of the current stat value and the new stat value, while max() selects the higher value.
  There is also ADD which is synonymous with FLAT, as well as REPLACE_GROUP and REPLACE_POWER for replacing abilities.
value/amount: use value for true/false stats and amount for numerical ones
race: for transformRace, name of race to transform to
permanent: for transformRace, whether the transformation should be permanent
shipTarget: the ship/room that the statBoost affects. The following options are available:
  ALL: Affects all rooms on both ships.
  PLAYER_SHIP and ENEMY_SHIP: Affects all rooms on a specific ship, irrespective of the source of the stat boost.
  ORIGINAL_SHIP: For augment boosts, affects all rooms on the ship possessing the augment. For crew boosts, affects all rooms on the ship who owns the crewmember.
  ORIGINAL_OTHER_SHIP: Opposite of ORIGINAL_SHIP.
  CURRENT_ALL: For augment boosts, same as ORIGINAL_SHIP. For crew boosts, affects all rooms on the ship the crewmember is currently on.
  OTHER_ALL: Opposite of CURRENT_ALL.
  CURRENT_ROOM: For crew boosts, affects the specific room the crewmember is in. Invalid for augment boosts.
  CREW_TARGET: For crew boosts, affects the specific crewmember being targeted by the source crewmember. Invalid for augment boosts.
  TARGETS_ME: For crew boosts, affects any crewmembers who are targeting the source crewmember. Invalid for augment boosts.
crewTarget: determines what crew the boost affects. it can be ALLIES, ENEMIES, ALL, CURRENT_ALLIES, CURRENT_ENEMIES, ORIGINAL_ALLIES, ORIGINAL_ENEMIES, SELF, or NONE.
  CURRENT_ALLIES and CURRENT_ENEMIES factor in mind control.
  ORIGINAL_ALLIES and ORIGINAL_ENEMIES completely ignore mind control, even with the "controllable mind control" augment.
  SELF is the same as NONE except it automatically sets affectsSelf to true.
droneTarget: determines whether the boost affects drones or not. it can be DRONES, CREW, or ALL (the default)
functionalTarget: boolean, for drones it determines whether the drone needs to be powered or not. Default is false.
healthReq: required crew health range. min/max are inclusive while above/below are exclusive.
healthFractionReq: required crew health fractional range (0.0-1.0). min/max are inclusive while above/below are exclusive. For example, <healthFractionReq below="1.0"/> means "not at full health".
oxygenReq: required oxygen percentage in the current room (0.0-100.0, crew suffocate at 5.0 and below). min/max are inclusive while above/below are exclusive.
fireCount: minimum and maximum number of fires in the room.
extraConditions: list of extra conditions. Same syntax as for power requirements, except without the text attributes for tooltips.
whiteList/blackList: determines the species that the boost applies to. whiteLists mean that only those species get the boost, and blackLists mean that only those species won't get the boost.
  Can also use load attribute to load a blueprintList, or <blueprintList load="LIST_NAME"/> to load any number of lists.
affectsSelf: determines if the boost affects the source in addition to its normal targets, defaults to false
priority: determines the timing of when the boost gets applied, useful when you want to change how things stack. A lower priority number means that the boost is calculated first, and the default priority is 0
systemList: the list of systems to use with the next variable. can be the file-name of any system (e.g. "mind") or all
systemRoomTarget: determines if the boost only works in the systems provided, or only *doesn't* work in those systems.
systemPowerDependency: determines the systems that affect the power of this stat boost. can be any amount of system file names, reactorMax, reactorCurrent, or all
systemPowerScaling: determines how the boost is affected by the total power bars within the systems in systemPowerDependency.
  noSys and hackedSys are values used for if the system isn't there and if the system is being hacked, respectively.
  The other tag names don't matter; the first value is used when the system is offline, and the second onwards determines the power at each given bar of power (with any amount of power over the max using the last number).
  If this tag is omitted, then it will default to a value of 0 when the system is unpowered, hacked, or nonpresent, and a value of 1 otherwise.
powerScalingShipTarget: the ship/room that the statBoost scales with. The following options are available:
  ALL: Scales with the sum of the systems on both ships.
  PLAYER_SHIP and ENEMY_SHIP: Scales with a specific ship, irrespective of the source of the stat boost.
  ORIGINAL_SHIP: For augment boosts, scales with the systems on the ship possessing the augment. For crew boosts, scales with the systems on the ship who owns the crewmember.
  ORIGINAL_OTHER_SHIP: Opposite of ORIGINAL_SHIP.
  CURRENT_ALL: For augment boosts, same as ORIGINAL_SHIP. For crew boosts, scales with the systems on the ship the crewmember is currently on.
  OTHER_ALL: Opposite of CURRENT_ALL.
  CURRENT_ROOM: Invalid for augment boosts. For crew boosts, scales only with a system if the providing crew is in that room.
deathEffect: When the statBoost name is "deathEffect", specifies the deathEffect to replace or be added to the crewmember's normal deathEffect.
powerEffect: When the statBoost name is "powerEffect", adds a new powerEffect.
  If boost type is SET then all the crew's existing powerEffects are removed and the new effect is added (or no power if none is specified).
  If boost type is ADD then the powerEffect is added as an additional power.
  If boost type is REPLACE_POWER then powers matching the whitelist (and not the blacklist) will be replaced; if no whitelist or blacklist then all are eligible. Replaces all powers unless amount is specified.
  If boost type is REPLACE_GROUP this is the same as REPLACE_POWER but the group of the powerEffect is automatically whitelisted.
powerWhitelist: List of powerEffect and/or powerResource that are replaced/modified by this statboost. Uses <powerEffect> and <powerResource> child tags; recommended to use "load" keyword.
powerGroupWhitelist: List of powerEffect and/or powerResource replacement groups that are replaced/modified by this statboost. Put the name as the tag, e.g. <foo/> for group named "foo".
powerBlacklist: List of powerEffect and/or powerResource that are excluded from being replaced/modified by this statboost.
powerGroupBlacklist: List of powerEffect and/or powerResource replacement groups that are excluded from being replaced/modified by this statboost.
  Note, power whitelists and blacklists work for all "powerEffect" REPLACE_POWER statboosts, as well as modifiers such as "powerCharges" and "chargesPerJump".
  Also "powerCooldown" and "activateWhenReady" are under this system.
  The "powerRechargeMultiplier" modifier is crewmember global and does not support whitelists/blacklists (for now, possibly will be in a future version along with cooldowns themselves).
duration: for augments, determines how long a boost will apply after jumping, measured in seconds (WIP). -1 is infinite.
jumpClear: If true, any applied timed stat boosts (including those with infinite duration) will be cleared on jump (does not affect passive boosts).
cloneClear: If true, any applied timed stat boosts (including those with infinite duration) will be cleared when the crew is cloned (or redeployed, if drone) (is true by default).
maxStacks: determines how many stacks of the boost can be applied to a single crewmember. Works per stat. Can have an "id" attribute which specifies an id to use for stat boosts that share a stack limit.
  If the id is not included then the stack limit applies only to that specific boost. Also works with recursive stat boosts but in which case does not respect priority value (priority is arbitrary).
statBoost: When statBoost name is "statBoost", the stat boost to provide to crewmembers meeting the criteria.
boostAnim: Name of animation to play on crewmembers who are being affected by this stat boost.
roomAnim: Room animation to spawn in the room of a room-based stat boost (currently only applies for room-based boosts, not crew/augment boosts that might affect certain rooms). Same syntax as customShip roomAnim.
dangerRating: Marks affected room(s) as dangerous to crew AI below this health fraction, AI-controlled crew will avoid dangerous rooms. Use value greater than 1 for all crew to avoid room.

<!-- Custom Rewards

Allows customization of autoRewards. You can both customize the ranges for scrap and resource rewards at each reward level, as well as add completely new reward types.

rewardScaling allows specifying scaling parameters for scrap: baseAmount, sectorAmount, and difficultyAmount.
resourceRewards allows you to specify a custom range for scrap and for each resource at each reward level.
You can also include scrap scaling for a particular reward level in resourceRewards and override what's in rewardScaling if you wish.

For resources, the formula is simply X = randint(min,max)
For scrap, the formula is X = randint(min,max) / 1000.0 * (baseAmount + max(0, worldLevel+difficultyAmount) * sectorAmount)
worldLevel is the current sector number minus 1; difficultyAmount is normally +1 on EASY, 0 on NORMAL, and -1 on HARD.

Each reward entry specifies a custom reward type, either overriding a vanilla type or adding a completely new one.
A reward type can have its own resourceRewards to alter the resource distributions for that reward type.
You can also specify which items will block the reward (e.g. to prevent a random weapon from overriding a specific weapon given by the same event) as well as which items the reward should generate (e.g. random weapon).
The actual reward then specifies which resources to include, as well as how many different resources to include (scrap is always included if specified and does not count towards this number).
The "bonus" entry allows you to generate an additional reward with a random chance.
You can add additional entries for specific reward levels for finer control.

Priority order for scrap/resource ranges:

1. resourceRewards of the autoReward type, for the specified resource and reward level.
2. Default resourceRewards, for the specified resource and reward level.
3. Vanilla range for the specified resource and reward level.

Priority order for scrap scaling:

1. resourceRewards of the autoReward type, for the specified reward level. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
2. rewardScaling of the autoReward type for the current difficulty.
3. rewardScaling of the autoReward type for NORMAL difficulty. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
4. Default resourceRewards, for the specified reward level. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
5. Default rewardScaling for the current difficulty.
6. Default rewardScaling for NORMAL difficulty. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
7. Vanilla scaling.

Example:

<rewards>
	<rewardScaling> -> Used for scrap scaling that does not depend on the reward level
		<scrap baseAmount="15.0" sectorAmount="6.0"/>
	</rewardScaling>

	<rewardScaling difficulty="0"> -> Override for specific difficulty level (0 = easy, 1 = normal, 2 = hard). Default when not specified is normal.
		<scrap baseAmount="15.0" sectorAmount="6.0" difficultyAmount="1"/> -> Same behaviour as vanilla easy; acts like you are 1 sector ahead compared to normal.
	</rewardScaling>

	<rewardScaling difficulty="2"> -> Note that for reward scaling at a specified difficulty, the automatic difficulty adjustment is cancelled unless difficultyAmount is explicitly specified in the child tags.
		<scrap sectorAmount="2.0"> -> Example of piecewise specification (specify the multiplier per sector). sectorAmount will be used to extrapolate if necessary (e.g. for infinite mode).
			<amount>15.0</amount> -> Hard sector 1
			<amount>15.0</amount> -> Hard sector 2
			<amount>20.0</amount> -> Hard sector 3
			<amount>24.5</amount> -> Hard sector 4
			<amount>28.5</amount> -> Hard sector 5
			<amount>32.0</amount> -> Hard sector 6
			<amount>35.0</amount> -> Hard sector 7
			<amount>37.5</amount> -> Hard sector 8
		</scrap>
	</rewardScaling>

<!-- Custom Sector Map

Can be used to customize the generation of the sector map.

Each sectorList determines the distribution of sectors up to a given sector number.
Each entry in a sectorList is a sectorType in sector_data.xml. The chance is the relative probability of rolling from that list (default chance = 1).
Chance must be an integer; they can sum to any number you'd like.
sectorLists must be in ascending sector order. They do not affect sector 1 or the final sector.

When using custom sectorLists you still need to list all sectors under the default CIVILIAN/HOSTILE/NEBULA lists as those are used to color the sectors on the map.

sectorMap can also go in sector_data.xml.

Example:

<sectorMap>
	<sectorList maxSector="m">
		<LIST_NAME_1 chance="x"/>
		<LIST_NAME_2 chance="y"/>
	</sectorList>
	<sectorList maxSector="n">
		<LIST_NAME_3 chance="z"/>
		<LIST_NAME_4 chance="w"/>
	</sectorList>
</sectorMap>

-->

<!-- Vanilla equivalent:
<sectorMap>
	<sectorList>
		<CIVILIAN chance="4"/>
		<HOSTILE chance="4"/>
		<NEBULA chance="2"/>
	</sectorList>
</sectorMap>
-->

<!-- Custom Ship Generators (WIP)

You can customize the algorithm used to generate enemy ships. This can be customized for different difficulty levels to affect how enemy ships generate.
Custom ship generator is required in order to recognize new systems added by Hyperspace.

Difficulty levels are 0 for Easy, 1 for Normal, and 2 for Hard. Sector values are the internal ones, which are 1 less than the displayed sector number.

Most tags which take a difficulty attribute default to Normal if none is specified.
As well, If you specify values for Normal, then Easy/Hard automatically inherit from Normal unless you explicitly specify values for Easy/Hard.
Finally, many tags will inherit values from a previous similar tag. For example, <systemLevelScaling system="shields" difficulty="0"> will first try to inherit from <systemLevelScaling system="shields" difficulty="1">,
then from <systemLevelScaling difficulty="0">, then from <systemLevelScaling difficulty="1">, then from the vanilla default. However, a tag can only inherit from tags which are above it, not below, so order matters.

<difficultyMod> is a global modifier which effectively advances/delays the enemy level. A positive value advances the enemy strength while a negative value delays it.

<sectorScaling> adjusts how quickly enemy ships scale overall, and is used for both crew count, as well as by default for systems.
minValue and maxValue are the lowest and highest scaling values to use. A value of 0 corresponds to the base amount while a value of 1 corresponds to the max amount for crew/systems.
minSector and maxSector are the sectors which correspond to minValue and maxValue. Ships will scale linearly between these sectors.

<systemLevelScaling> adjusts the scaling for systems, and applies to all systems unless the system attribute is included.
When generating an enemy ship, a maximum level is rolled for each system. The base value for this maximum is scaled between the starting power and the maximum power, then rounded down.
Then an additional random number is rolled and added on top. If the maximum value exceeds the blueprint maximum, it is reduced to the blueprint maximum.
<randomScaling> controls this additional roll. The random number rolled will be between 0 and the value specified in <randomScaling>, inclusive.
Multiple <randomScaling> tags can be included. Each subsequent tag should have a sector attribute to specify which sector it becomes effective in. These sectors must be in ascending order.
The first randomScaling tag should not have a sector attribute; if one is included then it will be ignored.

Note that it is not guaranteed that enemy ships will have their systems upgraded to the maximum value rolled for <systemLevelScaling>, as each ship gets a limited budget with which to upgrade.

Example:
<shipGenerators>
	<shipGenerator>
		<difficultyMod difficulty="0">-1</difficultyMod>

		<sectorScaling difficulty="x">
			<minValue>0.0</minValue>
			<maxValue>1.0</maxValue>

			<maxSector>8</maxSector>
		</sectorScaling>

		<systemLevelScaling system="shields" difficulty="x">
			<sectorScaling>
				<minValue>0.0</minValue>
				<maxValue>1.0</maxValue>
				<minSector>0</minSector>
				<maxSector>8</maxSector>
			</sectorScaling>
			<randomScaling>0</randomScaling>
			<randomScaling sector="0">1</randomScaling>
			<randomScaling sector="2">2</randomScaling>

<!-- Custom Event Characteristics

Now you can include Hyperspace tags inside vanilla <event> and <ship> tags inside the events.xml files! This avoids the need to maintain event parameters in two separate places (vanilla + hyperspace).
Syntax is generally the same as for <event> and <shipEvent> tags inside hyperspace.xml. Just include the tags you want alongside the usual vanilla tags.
For <store> and <secretSector> you can use the vanilla tag and just add a value for the custom store or sector, instead of needing two separate tags!
<unlockShip> vanilla and Hyperspace syntax are incompatible; you must use <unlockCustomShip> for hyperspace ships or the game will crash.
All tags in events.xml <event> and <ship> tags are non-recursive. However this is usually not a problem since you can include tags in unnamed events now.
You can continue to specify custom events and shipEvents in hyperspace.xml for backwards compatibility. It might also make sense in specific cases, such as recursive tags for complex events.

For beaconType and unvisitedTooltip/visitedTooltip, you can either use "id" or "text" as an attribute for the text - "id" pulls it from text_misc.xml while "text" uses the attribute's value.
Several other text attributes also allow either an "id" attribute or a literal string.

To remove a hidden augment, use <remove> in the actual event tag for the event and put "HIDDEN " before the augment name, e.g. to remove a hidden zoltan shield make a remove tag with "HIDDEN ENERGY_SHIELD"

<loadEvent> makes it so that the event that's loaded is NOT preloaded when the sector is generated,
and instead loaded only when needed. This helps with loading times at the start of a sector, as well as
reducing RAM usage and making events that load each other possible (useful for stuff like back buttons in events).
The seeded attribute makes it so that randomly generated things in the same beacon are the same every time that event
is loaded. Otherwise it will not depend on the seed/beacon and will instead be random every time the event is loaded in that beacon.

The req attribute for beaconType makes it so that the beacon label is only visible when the ship has a specific piece of equipment (augment, weapon, drone, race) installed.

You can load custom stores by supplying the custom store id
The event has to load a vanilla store in events.xml - it will be replaced with the custom store on load

<req> is used to make custom requirements for blue options (and also for beacon label requirements).
For example <choice req="CUSTOM_REQ"> in events.xml will look for a <req> named "CUSTOM_REQ" before looking for a blueprintList or blueprint.
Alternatively, you can use the keywords ANY, ALL, or SUM with a blueprintList (e.g. "ALL LIST_GATLING_PARTS") for simpler custom requirements to avoid needing to add a <req> here.
The keyword SEC can be used to check the current sector ID instead of checking a blueprint (e.g. "SEC CIVILIAN_SECTOR").
The keyword SHIP can be used to check the blueprint name of the player's ship.
The keyword ACH checks for an achievement name. This currently only works for custom achievements in <achievements>, not autogenerated victory/quest achievements.
The keyword ITEM forces an exact equipment check. This ignores custom reqs and augment functions, and hidden augments must be prefixed with "HIDDEN " (with a space) and are treated separately.
For example the name "ADV_SCANNERS" will check for the LRS augment functionality, "ITEM ADV_SCANNERS" will check for specifically the vanilla augment and not other augments with its function.
"ITEM ADV_SCANNERS" will only count non-hidden augments, while "ITEM HIDDEN ADV_SCANNERS" will count only hidden augments. ITEM can be used with a blueprintList, and checkCargo works.
The ITEM keyword is useful when an event relies on the exact item rather than the functionality (for example, an event where you sell or craft something that uses up the item).
The following keywords are also available: "difficulty" for the difficulty level enumeration, "dlc" for Advanced Edition on/off, "hull" for the player's remaining hull.

Triggered events are a tool that can be used to have events which occur once a certain condition is met.
The current triggers are elapsed time, jumps taken, damage taken by player or enemy, and crew lost by player or enemy.
A triggered event can also have a box that can be used to display the remaining time or jumps, and/or sounds for a countdown.
Due to the numerous trigger attributes, they are not listed in the example syntax for brevity, but instead are listed here:
  time: A time in seconds. The time only counts down while the game is unpaused.
  jumps: An integer number of jumps. If the "type" attribute is 0, this counts down by 1 every jump cycle (jump or wait). If the "type" attribute is 1, only actual jumps count.
  playerHull: The event triggers when the player's hull reaches this threshold.
  enemyHull: The event triggers when the enemy's hull reaches this threshold.
  playerDamage: Sets a playerHull threshold equal to the player's current hull minus this value.
  enemyDamage: Sets an enemyHull threshold equal to the enemy's current hull minus this value.
  enemyHullScaling: Scales enemyHull by this value multiplied by the current worldLevel (displayed sector number minus 1).
  enemyDamageScaling: Scales enemyDamage by this value multiplied by the current worldLevel (displayed sector number minus 1).
  playerCrew: The event triggers when the player has this many crew remaining or fewer.
  enemyCrew: The event triggers when the enemy has this many crew remaining or fewer.
  playerDeaths: Sets a playerCrew threshold equal to the player's current crew count minus this value.
  enemyDeaths: Sets an enemyCrew threshold equal to the enemy's current crew count minus this value.
All trigger attributes except for enemyHullScaling and enemyDamageScaling also have a "min" and "max" version (e.g. minTime and maxTime) to allow for random rolls.
The "loops" attribute also has "minLoops" and "maxLoops" for a random number of loops.

Syntax ->
<events>
	<bossShip yOffset="120">BOSS_BLUEPRINT</bossShip>                       Use the boss box for BOSS_BLUEPRINT. yOffset can be used to override the default boss offset.

	<eventFile>filename</eventFile>                                         Parses events_filename.xml for events using the vanilla parser.

	<revisitEvent seeded="true" ignoreUnique="false">NOTHING</revisitEvent> Automatically loads this event by default when revisiting any beacon. Does not affect dive beacons.

	<variable name="varname" op="set" val="0" min="0" max="0" var="_var_req_"/>                   See <variable> below for details. Applied at the start of the run.
	<metaVariable name="varname" op="set" val="0" min="0" max="0" var="_var_req_" force="false"/> See <metaVariable> below for details. Applied to a new profile (or existing profile with uninitialized variable).

	<sector name="SECTOR_ID" maxSector="999">                                              Custom sector specification. maxSector adds a maximum sector number for sector generation.
        <exitBeacon event="EVENT_NAME" rebelEvent="EVENT_NAME" nebulaEvent="EVENT_NAME"/>  Changes the default exit beacon event. nebulaEvent is used for nebula exits; rebelEvent is used if the rebels overtake the exit.
        <rebelBeacon event="EVENT_NAME" nebulaEvent="EVENT_NAME"/>                         Changes the default rebel fleet events. nebulaEvent is used for nebula fleet events.
        <removeFirstBeaconNebula/>                                                         Removes the nebula from the starting beacon.
        <priorityNebulaFix/>                                                               If a priorityEvent would not normally spawn because of the way nebulas generate, nebula priorityEvents will be added and non-nebula priorityEvents will have non-priority nebulas cleared to make room for them.
        <nebulaSector>false</nebulaSector>                                                 Overrides whether the sector is a nebula sector, affecting the fleet pursuit when the player is in nebula. Useful for secret sectors.
		<bossSector>false</bossSector>                                                     Overrides whether the sector is a boss sector, with flagship and scattered fleet mechanics. When not provided, defaults to normal behavior for that sector level (false for sectors 1-7, true for sector 8).
		<noExit/>                                                                          Removes the exit beacon, preventing normal travel to the next sector. Still creates an exit beacon event where the exit would be.
		<priorityEvent name="EVENT_LIST" min="0" max="0" priority="0"                      Like <event> in sector_data.xml but adds priority for sorting (high to low). >=0 goes above normal events.
		               req="req_name" lvl="1" max_lvl="999"/>                                If req is specified, only generate the event if the req is met upon sector entry.
		<quest event="EVENT_NAME" req="req_name" lvl="1" max_lvl="999">                    Adds events to spawn as quests on sector entry, with optional req to control spawning.

		<lastStand>false</lastStand>             Allows quests to spawn in the last stand.
		<createNebula>true</createNebula>        Adds the nebula environment to the event if a nebula beacon is selected. Default is true if and only if nonNebulaBeacon is true AND nebulaEvent is not given.
		<removeNebula>false</removeNebula>       Removes the nebula environment to the event if a nebula beacon is selected. Default is false. Overrides createNebula if true.
		<nebulaEvent>NEBULA_EVENT</nebulaEvent>  Specifies a different event to override the quest event if a nebula beacon is selected.
		<aggressive>0</aggressive>               Aggressive spawning flag. Ignores usual spawning restrictions based on player/fleet position. 0 is default. 1 will enable aggressive spawning if the quest would otherwise not
	</quest>                                       spawn at all. 2 will enable aggressive spawning if the quest would otherwise not spawn in the current sector.

		<weapon difficulty="1" name="LASER_HEAVY_1_1DMG" count="7"/>    All weapon types work. All weapons fire a single shot except for BURST (e.g. flak) which fires a single blast.
		<weapon difficulty="2" name="LASER_HEAVY_1_1DMG" count="7"/>    The vanilla barrage uses the LASER_HEAVY_1 blueprint but sets the damage to 1.

<!-- Custom Stores
	The Custom Store id will be what is used to spawn the store from a custom event

	Prices:
		These same tags can be used for the price of any item/resource/hull repair
		flat or not flat determines whether the amount is just added onto the price of the item or if it's a multiplier respectively

		<item>
			<price>10</price>         Option 1: Set price (if price is not set, defaults to -1 meaning it will use the blueprint price)
			<price min="5" max="10"/> Option 2: Min-max price, uses random between min-max if not <sectorScaled/>

			<sectorScaled/> chooses between min-max price depending on sector ((max - min) * ((sector - 1) / 7) + min)

			<modifier flat="false">0.8</modifier>        Option 1: Set modifier (flat is false by default)
			<modifier min="0.5" max="0.9" flat="false"/> Option 2: random modifier between min-max
		</item>

	Hull repair:
		If a hullRepair tag is not set, you will not be able to repair your hull at the store

	Resources:
		type can be "missiles", "drones", or "fuel"
		count can either have min and max attributes, or a set amount

	Category:
		A store category has 3 (or fewer) items of a specific type inside it
		the type for a category can be: "WEAPONS", "DRONES", "AUGMENTS", "CREW", "SYSTEMS"

		Stores can have infinite categories, pages will be created to accomodate them

		customTitle is the title that appears above the store items. If it's not set it will use the default for the type

		A category can have a group that it belongs to
		Only one category per group is displayed, unless a group is not set
		The groupChance determines the chance that the category will be chosen
		If a groupChance is not set for a category, it will evenly distribute the chance between the categories that don't have a groupChance set (while keeping the chance for the ones that do have it set)
		NOTE: the sum of all groupChances in a group should never go beyond 100

		allowDuplicates sets whether or not duplicate checking is enabled for that single category (duplicate checking is only used for items using a blueprintList)

		chance is the chance that the category shows up at all (this is rolled separately from groupChance)

	Item:
		blueprint can either be empty or a blueprint/blueprintList - if it is empty, it will use vanilla generation
		mysteryItem decides whether or not you can see what the item is before purchasing

		System id list: shields, engines, oxygen, weapons, drones, medbay, pilot, sensors, doors, teleporter, cloaking, artillery, battery, clonebay, mind, hacking

	Item purchase limit sets the number of total items that can be purchased from a store

    <customStore id="STORE_CUSTOM">
        <itemPurchaseLimit>2</itemPurchaseLimit>

		<hullRepair>
			<price min="3" max="8"/>
			<sectorScaled/>
			<modifier min="-2" max="2" flat="true"/>
		</hullRepair>

		<resource>
			<type>missiles</type>
			<count min="8" max="20"/>
			<price>2</price>
		</resource>
		<resource>
			<type>drones</type>
			<count min="8" max="20"/>
			<price>2</price>
		</resource>

		With the two categories below, there is a 25% chance that the category chosen will be the mystery item category, with items chosen from the MYSTERY_ITEM_POOL blueprintList
		(Meaning there is a 75% chance of choosing the non-mystery item category, which will contain visible items from a STORE_CUSTOM_WEAPON_POOL blueprintList)
		<category type="WEAPONS" group="1">
            <item>
                <blueprint>MYSTERY_ITEM_POOL</blueprint>

<!-- Custom Choice Text Color
To enable this feature, set enabled="true". You can register as many choice text color themes as you like.
syncResourceBoxColor: if true, the outline of the resource box and the text within it will be synchronized to the current choice color.

About <choiceColor/>:
It needs attribute "name" to be identified.
It takes 4 tags as children: <normal/>, <hover/>, <disabled/>, <blue_option/>.

	<normal/> : replace the vanilla normal text color(white).
	<hover/> : replace the vanilla yellow color when the cursor is over the text.
	<disabled/> : replace the vanilla gray color when the choice is disabled.
	<blue_option/> replace the vanilla blue option text color(cyan).

	Missing any tag means not replacing that color.

	Each tags takes 4 attribute: r, g, b, a. Each value is ranged 0 to 255.
	You need to specify r(red), g(green) and b(blue). a(opacity) is optional, if missing it defaults to 255.

<!--Custom Text Style
You can apply custom text style in the particular part of a text.

Notation: Surround the part you want to appy custom style in a text with start flag ([style[EXPRESSIONS]]) and close flag ([[/style]])

Expressions:

notation: "color:RRGGBB" or "color:RRGGBBAA" with hexadecimal (00 to FF). If AA (opacity) is ommitted, it defaults to 0xFF (255).
example: <text>This text is painted, like [style[color:FF0000]]Red[[/style]], [style[color:00FF00]]Green[[/style]] and [style[color:0000FF]]Blue[[/style]]!</text>
