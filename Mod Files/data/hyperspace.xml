<!-- Infinite Ships

You can make a customShip with no name (or name "default") to set default values for all ships
Make sure this is above every <ship> and <customShip> tag, though

<roomAnim> lets you choose animations for rooms (from animations.xml)
roomAnim render layers:
0 - draws below everything except floor, including no O2 stripes - can't see when room has no vision
1 - draws below everything but above O2 stripes - can't see when room has no vision
2 - draws below crew - can see when room has no vision
3 - draws above crew - can see when room has no vision, but not when you can't actually see the room outline
4 - draws above everything

<empty> in shipOrder means that the slot that the ship would take up is empty instead

Unlocks:
variant attribute is what variant you want the unlock method for (a, b or c)

type is the unlock method (0 is beat flagship, 1 is reach sector, 2 is any victory, 3 is other ship unlocks, 4 is for event unlocks)
shipReq is the ship that you have to do it with to unlock it
value is only used for reach sector currently which defines which sector the player has to reach
silent tag defines whether or not it will show up in the top right and plays the sound

for the achievement icon that appears on the top right when you unlock the ship, you will need to add an icon in img/achievements 
it will use whatever the layoutFile is with "_1" put on the end
so for the engi ship, the layoutFile is mup_engi_b, so the icon would be img/achievements/mup_engi_b_1.png

you can also put multiple unlock methods which will let the player do ANY of them to unlock the ship
putting the secret attribute on the ship tag will make the ship show up as "Unidentified Cruiser" when hovering over it in the ship selection screen

<!-- Custom Races

For buttonText and tooltip you can either use "id" or use the value of buttonText - "id" pulls it from text_misc.xml.

jumpCooldown can either be "continue", "reset", or "full", and it is "full" by default (for crystals).

animSheet pulls from img/people/<animSheet>.png and acts as a layer on top of the crew

healSpeed determines how fast crew heal in the medbay/from non-true healing sources and how fast drones heal in the drone control room.

When animFrame is set for <powerEffect> and <temporaryPowerEffect> it makes it so that the effect only happens on that frame of the effect animation.

When animSoundFrame is set for <repairSounds> AND <animBase> is rock, instead of having a looping repair sound it will instead play a single sound at that frame of the animation.
Support was recently added for non-rock <animBase>, but is untested.

<transformRace> in <powerEffect> allows the crewmember to transform into another race while keeping their name and skills

<nameRace> allows the crewmember to change into a different race if they are given a certain name (indicated by the transformName attribute), and the changeIfSame attribute (default to true) specifies whether they change when they *are* named that, or *aren't* named that

<animBase> can be either mantis or rock

Syntax -> 

<crew>
	(default human values except where they're obviously not)
	<race name="newRace">

<!-- Custom drones

crewBlueprint needs to be defined as a crewBlueprint in blueprints.xml and a custom race in the <crew> tag in hyperspace.xml
tooltipName is the name that shows up when you hover over the drone
A flying boarding drone uses a _fly animation (e.g. newDrone_fly) for its texture
The animations for drones will use the <crewBlueprint> tag for a prefix. Look at "boarder_" animations in vanilla as an example.

Syntax ->

<drones>
	<drone name="BATTLE_CUSTOM">
		<crewBlueprint>newDrone</crewBlueprint>
		<tooltipName>Anti-Personnel Drone II</tooltipName>
	</drone>
</drones>

-->

<drones>

</drones>

<!-- Custom Augments

<locked> means you cannot remove it (sell or replace with another augment) once it's equipped.
useForReqs is for whether you want the augment to work for blue options or not. True by default.
warning attribute being false removes red warning text
sys attribute means that a functional system is required for the augment to be effective.
modifyChoiceTextScrap is only used for SCRAP_COLLECTOR; it causes the scrap amounts shown in event dialogues to account for the augment. It does not affect the "scrap collected" in the stats or the player's score.

<superShield> lets you specify a custom super shield value instead of the default 5. Generally should be used along with <function name="ENERGY_SHIELD"/> so it still counts for blue options, etc.
You can also specify a custom shield image and tint. Custom images are useful for colors that don't work well on the standard blue shield, such as yellow, red, pink, and white.
Using <shieldImage> is equivalent to using both <playerImage> and <enemyImage>.

<!-- Stat boosts

NOTE:
TO USE STAT BOOSTS, THE RACE MUST BE LAID OUT AS A CUSTOM CREW IN THE <crew> TAG

Stat boosts can be added in one of two ways: through crew, and through augments.
For augments and crew active abilities, statboosts should be placed in a <statBoosts> tag (as many as you want, the <statBoosts> tag should contain all of them)
For passive crew boosts, they should be placed in a <passiveStatBoosts> tag, but otherwise the code is the same
As the name implies, stat boosts can be used to boost (or just generally modify) a given stat, but also you can use stat boosts to apply other stat boosts to crew (therefore buffing everyone except the recipient) by using "statBoost" for the statBoost name

boostType: what the boost does to the stat; for numerical amounts, it can be FLAT, MULT, or SET, and for true/false values it can be SET or FLIP
value/amount: use value for true/false stats and amount for numerical ones
shipTarget: the ship/room that the statBoost affects. For augments, you can use PLAYER_SHIP, ENEMY_SHIP, ORIGINAL_SHIP, ORIGINAL_OTHER_SHIP, or ALL, and for crew you can use the same but also OTHER_ALL, CURRENT_ROOM, and CURRENT_ALL
crewTarget: determines what crew the boost affects. it can be ALLIES, ENEMIES, ALL, CURRENT_ALLIES, or CURRENT_ENEMIES. CURRENT_ALLIES and CURRENT_ENEMIES factor in mind control.
droneTarget: determines whether the boost affects drones or not. it can be DRONES, CREW, or ALL (the default)
whiteList/blackList: determines the species that the boost applies to. whiteLists mean that only those species get the boost, and blackLists mean that only those species won't get the boost.
  Can also use load attribute to load a blueprintList.
affectsSelf: determines if the boost affects the source in addition to its normal targets, defaults to false
priority: determines the timing of when the boost gets applied, useful when you want to change how things stack. A bigger priority number means that the boost is calculated first, and the default priority is 0
systemList: the list of systems to use with the next variable. can be the file-name of any system (e.g. "mind") or all
systemRoomTarget: determines if the boost only works in the systems provided, or only *doesn't* work in those systems.
systemPowerDependency: determines the systems that affect the power of this stat boost. can be any amount of system file names, reactorMax, reactorCurrent, or all
systemPowerScaling: determines how the boost is affected by the total power bars within the systems in systemPowerDependency.
  noSys and hackedSys are values used for if the system isn't there and if the system is being hacked, respectively.
  The other tag names don't matter; the first value is used when the system is offline, and the second onwards determines the power at each given bar of power (with any amount of power over the max using the last number).
deathEffect: When the statBoost name is "deathEffect", specifies the deathEffect to replace or be added to the crewmember's normal deathEffect.
powerEffect: When the statBoost name is "powerEffect", adds a new powerEffect which replaces the crewmember's normal powerEffect. Active powerEffects will not be replaced until they finish.
duration: for augments, determines how long a boost will apply after jumping, measured in seconds (WIP)
maxStacks: determines how many stacks of the boost can be applied to a single crewmember. Works per stat. Can have an "id" attribute which specifies an id to use for stat boosts that share a stack limit. If the id is not included then the stack limit applies only to that specific boost.
statBoost: When statBoost name is "statBoost", the stat boost to provide to crewmembers meeting the criteria.

<!-- Custom Rewards

Allows customization of autoRewards. You can both customize the ranges for scrap and resource rewards at each reward level, as well as add completely new reward types.

rewardScaling allows specifying scaling parameters for scrap: baseAmount, sectorAmount, and difficultyAmount.
resourceRewards allows you to specify a custom range for scrap and for each resource at each reward level.
You can also include scrap scaling for a particular reward level in resourceRewards and override what's in rewardScaling if you wish.

For resources, the formula is simply X = randint(min,max)
For scrap, the formula is X = randint(min,max) / 1000.0 * (baseAmount + max(0, worldLevel+difficultyAmount) * sectorAmount)
worldLevel is the current sector number minus 1; difficultyAmount is normally +1 on EASY, 0 on NORMAL, and -1 on HARD.

Each reward entry specifies a custom reward type, either overriding a vanilla type or adding a completely new one.
A reward type can have its own resourceRewards to alter the resource distributions for that reward type.
You can also specify which items will block the reward (e.g. to prevent a random weapon from overriding a specific weapon given by the same event) as well as which items the reward should generate (e.g. random weapon).
The actual reward then specifies which resources to include, as well as how many different resources to include (scrap is always included if specified and does not count towards this number).
The "bonus" entry allows you to generate an additional reward with a random chance.
You can add additional entries for specific reward levels for finer control.

Priority order for scrap/resource ranges:

1. resourceRewards of the autoReward type, for the specified resource and reward level.
2. Default resourceRewards, for the specified resource and reward level.
3. Vanilla range for the specified resource and reward level.

Priority order for scrap scaling:

1. resourceRewards of the autoReward type, for the specified reward level. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
2. rewardScaling of the autoReward type for the current difficulty.
3. rewardScaling of the autoReward type for NORMAL difficulty. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
4. Default resourceRewards, for the specified reward level. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
5. Default rewardScaling for the current difficulty.
6. Default rewardScaling for NORMAL difficulty. difficultyAmount is automatically adjusted.
7. Vanilla scaling.

Example:

<rewards>
	<rewardScaling> -> Used for scrap scaling that does not depend on the reward level
		<scrap baseAmount="15.0" sectorAmount="6.0"/>
	</rewardScaling>
	
	<rewardScaling difficulty="0"> -> Override for specific difficulty level (0 = easy, 1 = normal, 2 = hard). Default when not specified is normal.
		<scrap baseAmount="15.0" sectorAmount="6.0" difficultyAmount="1"/> -> Same behaviour as vanilla easy; acts like you are 1 sector ahead compared to normal.
	</rewardScaling>
	
	<rewardScaling difficulty="2"> -> Note that for reward scaling at a specified difficulty, the automatic difficulty adjustment is cancelled unless difficultyAmount is explicitly specified in the child tags.
		<scrap sectorAmount="2.0"> -> Example of piecewise specification (specify the multiplier per sector). sectorAmount will be used to extrapolate if necessary (e.g. for infinite mode).
			<amount>15.0</amount> -> Hard sector 1
			<amount>15.0</amount> -> Hard sector 2
			<amount>20.0</amount> -> Hard sector 3
			<amount>24.5</amount> -> Hard sector 4
			<amount>28.5</amount> -> Hard sector 5
			<amount>32.0</amount> -> Hard sector 6
			<amount>35.0</amount> -> Hard sector 7
			<amount>37.5</amount> -> Hard sector 8
		</scrap>

<!-- Custom Event Characteristics

Now you can include Hyperspace tags inside vanilla <event> and <ship> tags inside the events.xml files! This avoids the need to maintain event parameters in two separate places (vanilla + hyperspace).
Syntax is generally the same as for <event> and <shipEvent> tags inside hyperspace.xml. Just include the tags you want alongside the usual vanilla tags.
For <store> and <secretSector> you can use the vanilla tag and just add a value for the custom store or sector, instead of needing two separate tags!
<unlockShip> vanilla and Hyperspace syntax are incompatible; you must use <unlockCustomShip> for hyperspace ships or the game will crash.
All tags in events.xml <event> and <ship> tags are non-recursive. However this is usually not a problem since you can include tags in unnamed events now.
You can continue to specify custom events and shipEvents in hyperspace.xml for backwards compatibility. It might also make sense in specific cases, such as recursive tags for complex events.

For beaconType and unvisitedTooltip/visitedTooltip, you can either use "id" or "text" as an attribute for the text - "id" pulls it from text_misc.xml while "text" uses the attribute's value.
Several other text attributes also allow either an "id" attribute or a literal string.

To remove a hidden augment, use <remove> in the actual event tag for the event and put "HIDDEN " before the augment name, e.g. to remove a hidden zoltan shield make a remove tag with "HIDDEN ENERGY_SHIELD"

<loadEvent> makes it so that the event that's loaded is NOT preloaded when the sector is generated,
and instead loaded only when needed. This helps with loading times at the start of a sector, as well as
reducing RAM usage and making events that load each other possible (useful for stuff like back buttons in events).
The seeded attribute makes it so that randomly generated things in the same beacon are the same every time that event
is loaded. Otherwise it will not depend on the seed/beacon and will instead be random every time the event is loaded in that beacon.

The req attribute for beaconType makes it so that the beacon label is only visible when the ship has a specific piece of equipment (augment, weapon, drone, race) installed.

You can load custom stores by supplying the custom store id
The event has to load a vanilla store in events.xml - it will be replaced with the custom store on load

<req> is used to make custom requirements for blue options (and also for beacon label requirements).
For example <choice req="CUSTOM_REQ"> in events.xml will look for a <req> named "CUSTOM_REQ" before looking for a blueprintList or blueprint.
Alternatively, you can use the keywords ANY, ALL, or SUM with a blueprintList (e.g. "ALL LIST_GATLING_PARTS") for simpler custom requirements to avoid needing to add a <req> here.
The keyword SEC can be used to check the current sector ID instead of checking a blueprint (e.g. "SEC CIVILIAN_SECTOR").

Triggered events are a tool that can be used to have events which occur once a certain condition is met.
The current triggers are elapsed time, jumps taken, damage taken by player or enemy, and crew lost by player or enemy.
A triggered event can also have a box that can be used to display the remaining time or jumps, and/or sounds for a countdown.
Due to the numerous trigger attributes, they are not listed in the example syntax for brevity, but instead are listed here:
  time: A time in seconds. The time only counts down while the game is unpaused.
  jumps: An integer number of jumps. This counts down by 1 every time the player jumps (or waits).
  playerHull: The event triggers when the player's hull reaches this threshold.
  enemyHull: The event triggers when the enemy's hull reaches this threshold.
  playerDamage: Sets a playerHull threshold equal to the player's current hull minus this value.
  enemyDamage: Sets an enemyHull threshold equal to the enemy's current hull minus this value.
  enemyHullScaling: Scales enemyHull by this value multiplied by the current worldLevel (displayed sector number minus 1).
  enemyDamageScaling: Scales enemyDamage by this value multiplied by the current worldLevel (displayed sector number minus 1).
  playerCrew: The event triggers when the player has this many crew remaining or fewer.
  enemyCrew: The event triggers when the enemy has this many crew remaining or fewer.
  playerDeaths: Sets a playerCrew threshold equal to the player's current crew count minus this value.
  enemyDeaths: Sets an enemyCrew threshold equal to the enemy's current crew count minus this value.
All trigger attributes except for enemyHullScaling and enemyDamageScaling also have a "min" and "max" version (e.g. minTime and maxTime) to allow for random rolls.
The "loops" attribute also has "minLoops" and "maxLoops" for a random number of loops.

<!-- Custom Stores
	The Custom Store id will be what is used to spawn the store from a custom event
	
	Prices:
		These same tags can be used for the price of any item/resource/hull repair
		flat or not flat determines whether the amount is just added onto the price of the item or if it's a multiplier respectively
		
		<item>
			<price>10</price>         Option 1: Set price (if price is not set, defaults to -1 meaning it will use the blueprint price)
			<price min="5" max="10"/> Option 2: Min-max price, uses random between min-max if not <sectorScaled/>

			<sectorScaled/> chooses between min-max price depending on sector ((max - min) * ((sector - 1) / 7) + min)

			<modifier flat="false">0.8</modifier>        Option 1: Set modifier (flat is false by default)
			<modifier min="0.5" max="0.9" flat="false"/> Option 2: random modifier between min-max
		</item>
	
	Hull repair:
		If a hullRepair tag is not set, you will not be able to repair your hull at the store
		
	Resources:
		type can be "missiles", "drones", or "fuel"
		count can either have min and max attributes, or a set amount
		
	Category:
		A store category has 3 (or fewer) items of a specific type inside it
		the type for a category can be: "WEAPONS", "DRONES", "AUGMENTS", "CREW", "SYSTEMS"
		
		Stores can have infinite categories, pages will be created to accomodate them
		
		customTitle is the title that appears above the store items. If it's not set it will use the default for the type
		
		A category can have a group that it belongs to
		Only one category per group is displayed, unless a group is not set
		The groupChance determines the chance that the category will be chosen
		If a groupChance is not set for a category, it will evenly distribute the chance between the categories that don't have a groupChance set (while keeping the chance for the ones that do have it set)
		NOTE: the sum of all groupChances in a group should never go beyond 100
		
		allowDuplicates sets whether or not duplicate checking is enabled for that single category (duplicate checking is only used for items using a blueprintList)
		
		chance is the chance that the category shows up at all (this is rolled separately from groupChance)
		
	Item:
		blueprint can either be empty or a blueprint/blueprintList - if it is empty, it will use vanilla generation
		mysteryItem decides whether or not you can see what the item is before purchasing
		
		System id list: shields, engines, oxygen, weapons, drones, medbay, pilot, sensors, doors, teleporter, cloaking, artillery, battery, clonebay, mind, hacking
	
	Item purchase limit sets the number of total items that can be purchased from a store	
	
    <customStore id="STORE_CUSTOM">
        <itemPurchaseLimit>2</itemPurchaseLimit>
		
		<hullRepair>
			<price min="3" max="8"/>
			<sectorScaled/>
			<modifier min="-2" max="2" flat="true"/>
		</hullRepair>
		
		<resource>
			<type>missiles</type>
			<count min="8" max="20"/>
			<price>2</price>
		</resource>
		<resource>
			<type>drones</type>
			<count min="8" max="20"/>
			<price>2</price>
		</resource>
		
		With the two categories below, there is a 25% chance that the category chosen will be the mystery item category, with items chosen from the MYSTERY_ITEM_POOL blueprintList
		(Meaning there is a 75% chance of choosing the non-mystery item category, which will contain visible items from a STORE_CUSTOM_WEAPON_POOL blueprintList)
		<category type="WEAPONS" group="1">
            <item>
                <blueprint>MYSTERY_ITEM_POOL</blueprint>
